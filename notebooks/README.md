- `chromosome_CNA_link.ipynb`: code used to generate the chromosome ideogram of Fig 3D + Suppl. Fig. 2
- `Compare metasignatures and known-Neftel.ipynb`: code used to generate the heatmaps of Fig 2E
- `Compare metasignatures and known.ipynb`: code used to generate the heatmaps of Fig 2D
- `ESCC_usecase.ipynb`: code used to generate the plots of Fig 4B-C-D-E-F
- `ESCC_survivalusecase.ipynb`: code used to generate the plots of Fig 4G-H
- `plot-latent-spaces.ipynb`: code used to generate the plots of Fig 2A, Fig 3A and Fig 4A
- `simulated-data.ipynb`: code used to generate the plots of Fig 2C
- `stability-analysis.ipynb`: code used to generate the plots of Fig 2F-G and Suppl Fig 1
- `TCGA-associations.ipynb`: code used to generate the plots of Fig 3E

In addition, we provide the saved results of significant gains associated with metasignature 5 in ESCC as `sign_gains_metasig5_escc.csv`/
