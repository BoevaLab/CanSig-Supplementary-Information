# Simulated cancer datasets

The `simul` package allows simulating datasets, as we did in the paper.


## Installation
First, install the dependencies:
```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Second, run tests:
```
$ export PYTHONPATH=.
$ pytest
```

## Demos

To start with the framework, we recommend running example Jupyter notebooks, which can be found in the `notebooks/` directory.
